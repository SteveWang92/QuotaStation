# QuotaStation contributor guidance

This repository follows Steve's global project rules. The rules below are specific to
QuotaStation and take precedence when they differ.

## Project status

- QuotaStation has a selected architecture and is waiting for implementation approval.
- Read `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.local.md` when it exists before changing implementation scope.
- Keep public documentation free of machine-specific paths, account details, credentials,
  and private usage data.

## Local-only files

- Mark every local-only file with `.local` in its filename.
- Rely on the repository-wide `*.local` and `*.local.*` ignore rules.
- Do not add a one-off `.gitignore` entry for an individual local file.

## Product constraints

- Keep provider integrations read-only unless a future feature is explicitly approved.
- Never expose provider credentials, prompts, source code, file paths, or raw session data
  outside the local machine.
- Reuse one normalized provider and usage model across tray, widget, and dashboard surfaces.
- Deliver Codex first; Claude, Gemini, and other providers must not block the first release.
- Use Tauri 2 with a Rust core and a React/TypeScript renderer unless Steve explicitly
  approves an architecture change.
- For AI client logs and provider behavior, inspect established open-source implementations
  first and directly reuse compatible code when practical.
- Pin every reused implementation to an audited revision and record its license,
  attribution, security behavior, and local changes in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- Do not add vendor hash manifests, whole-tree integrity hashes, or CI hash verification
  unless Steve explicitly approves that maintenance cost first.
- Do not reimplement the Codex log parser unless direct use or minimal vendoring of the
  reviewed `ccusage` Rust adapter is blocked by a concrete incompatibility.
- Keep file, process, provider protocol, credential, and database access in the Rust core;
  the renderer receives only normalized data through narrow commands and events.

## Verification

- Documentation-only work needs only a focused file review.
- Once the application exists, use the minimum local build or start check required by the
  global rules.
